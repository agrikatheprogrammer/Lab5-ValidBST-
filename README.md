# Lab5-ValidBST-
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
For this lab, we will change the definition of a BST slightly, for simplicity:

Remember, this property should apply to all subtrees as well. 

Function definition for Java: 

public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {

 }
Function definition for Python:
def isValidBST(self, root):
